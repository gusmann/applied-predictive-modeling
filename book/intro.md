# Welcome to Applied Predictive Modeling (in Python)

This project aims to distill the content and examples in Applied Predictive Modeling {cite}`applied_predictive_modeling_2013`, which focuses on the R programming language, using Python instead. It's meant to help readers of the book follow along using executable Jupyter Notebooks with a Python kernel. You can leverage this project as a Python module, a series of executable Jupyter Notebooks, and/or a website or PDF document to follow along.

The `applied_predictive_modeling` Python module is meant to encapsulate and structure Python code in a manner that allows readers to focus on the . hopefully provides the reader with best-practices they can leverage when writing their own.
