# Welcome to Applied Predictive Modeling  

This project aims to distill the content and examples in Applied Predictive Modeling {cite}`applied_predictive_modeling_2013`, which focuses on the R programming language, using Python and/or Rust instead. It's meant to help readers of the book follow along using executable Jupyter Notebooks with a Python kernel, while digging into low-level optimizations in Rust when appropriate. You can leverage this project as a Python module w/ Rust crate, a series of executable Jupyter Notebooks, and/or a website or PDF document to follow along.

The `applied_predictive_modeling` Python module and Rust crate encapsulate and structure code required to perform examples from the book in a manner that allows readers to focus on learning the statistical model concepts. Care in producing clean, well-tested code will be taken, which hopefully provide the reader with best-practices they can take with them when writing their own. Books such as Clean Code{cite}``
